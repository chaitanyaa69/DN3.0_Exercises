Time Complexity Analysis

1. Add Product:

Operation: inventory.put(product.getProductId(), product)
Time Complexity: O(1) average case.


2. Update Product:

Operation: inventory.put(product.getProductId(), product)
Time Complexity: O(1) average case (same as add since it replaces the value).


3. Delete Product:

Operation: inventory.remove(productId)
Time Complexity: O(1) average case.


4. Get Product:

Operation: inventory.get(productId)
Time Complexity: O(1) average case.
