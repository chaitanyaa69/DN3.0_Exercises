Time Complexity of Operations

1. Add Task:

Time Complexity: O(n) (where n is the number of tasks)
Explanation: Adding a task involves traversing to the end of the list, which takes linear time.

2. Search Task:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: In the worst case, we may need to search through all tasks to find the target task.

3. Traverse Tasks:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: Traversing through all tasks takes linear time.

4. Delete Task:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: Deleting a task involves searching for the task, which takes linear time.
