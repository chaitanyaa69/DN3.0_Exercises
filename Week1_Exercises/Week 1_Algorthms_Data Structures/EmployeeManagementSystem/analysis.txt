Analysis
Time Complexity of Operations

1. Add Employee

Time Complexity O(1) (when the array is not full)
Explanation Adding an element to the next available position in the array takes constant time.

2. Search Employee

Time Complexity O(n)
Explanation In the worst case, we may need to search through all elements to find the target employee.

3. Traverse Employees

Time Complexity O(n)
Explanation Traversing through all elements in the array takes linear time.

4. Delete Employee

Time Complexity O(n)
Explanation Deleting an element involves shifting all subsequent elements to fill the gap, which takes linear time.
