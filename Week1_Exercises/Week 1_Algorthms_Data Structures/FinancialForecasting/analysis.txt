Analysis

1. Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm
Time Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: The recursive algorithm makes a single call for each period, leading to a linear time complexity proportional to the number of periods.
2. Space Complexity:

Space Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: The space complexity is also linear because each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.
